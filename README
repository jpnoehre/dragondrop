DragonDrop is a web-based area editor for The Final Challenge MUD
(http://finalchallenge.net/) being written in Django. There is presently
no documentation and the project is unfinished (i.e. not in a usable
state). However, development is ongoing.

Any interested parties are welcome to contribute to the project. Feel
free to get in touch.
